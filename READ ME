INSTRUCTIONS:
1) The basis of the game is that you will have to spin the wheel to aquire either points, a free spin, or even bankrupt.
2) As you have aquired some points, you will be able to guess a letter that could be in the puzzle. If you get the guess wrong then the game will deduct 200 points as a penalty. 
If you guess right you will get a bonus of 200 points in addition to what your current points are.
3)The other option you wull have would be to guess the whole puzzle if you have the idea in what the answer will be.
4)The game will end as soon as have reached 0 points or have solved all the available puzzles.
