INSTRUCTIONS:
1) The basis of the game is that you will have to spin the wheel to aquire either points, a free spin, or even bankrupt.
2) As you have aquired some points, you will be able to guess a letter that could be in the puzzle. If you get the guess wrong then the game will deduct 200 points as a penalty. 
If you guess right you will get a bonus of 200 points in addition to what your current points are.
3)The game will end as soon as have reached 0 points or have solved all the available puzzles.
